To, Maria Diana Oliveros:<br>

Dear Diana,<br>

	Our paths crossed when we found ourselves in the same place, both seeking God’s will as the summer camp ended with memories and laughter. I saw every performance you did during the roleplays, and through those moments, we began to recognize each other. A week later, we started to connect and since then, I have liked and loved you, ever since our spark began seven months ago.<br>
<br>


I am so thankful to have you as my love that someone who supports me in every way and treats me as if we were destined for each other. I know I will never be alone because I have you by my side. As we continue our journey together, through every hurdle and challenge we may face, I promise that I will never give up on us. Will you be my Valentines?<br> </h3>
